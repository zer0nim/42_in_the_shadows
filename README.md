# in-the-shadows [[42](https://www.42.fr/) project]

## Project
The goal of this project is to make a game inspired by [Shadowmatic](http://shadowmatic.com/) in `C#` and `Unity`

### The Game

**In-the-shadows** is a puzzle game where you rotate abstract objects in a spotlight to find recognizable silhouettes in projected shadows

There are 4 levels of difficulty
- One object where you can only apply **horizontal** rotations
- One object where you can apply **horizontal** / **vertical** rotations
- Multiples objects where you can apply **horizontal** / **vertical** rotations
- Multiples objects where you can apply **horizontal** / **vertical** rotations and **move through space**

## Controls

to rotate vertically simply use `Clic` and drag

to rotate vertically use `CTRL` + `Clic` and drag

to move the object use `SHIFT` + `Clic` and drag

## Save

The game automatically saves your progress locally

If you want you can delete your progress in the "Story mode" menu
